# Modal-Window

## A simple popup window using HTML CSS and JavaScript for learning work with DOM and DOM manipulation and refactoring code to ensure compliance with the DRY principle.

In this project, variable and function declarations were used to store repetitive code, making the code more readable, expressive, and declarative.

I used:
`querySelector` method, `querySelectorAll` method, `classList` property, `remove` method, `add` method, `addEventListener` method, `KeyboardEvent` object, etc.
